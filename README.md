# prototype_wsservcli
simple chat using node.js and websockets from ws and wss 

to run git clone the repo (this will get all server side stuff)

to get client side, create a folder within the expressserver directory called "public" and but the files in the master branch into it

you should have everything you need in terms of files to run

your directory should look like this

|->prototype_wsservcli <br/>
|-->node_modules(npm puts its stuff in here once you npm install) <br/>
|-->package-lock.json <br/>
|-->package.json <br/>
|-->server.js <br/>
|-->public <br/>
|--->index.html <br/>
|--->script.js <br/>
|--->styles.css <br/>

make sure you have node.js installed

then 'npm install' in the prototype_wsservcli directory

start the server with the command node server.js

navigate to localhost:3000 (default) to see the webpage locally
