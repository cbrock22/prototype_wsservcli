# prototype_wsservcli
simple chat using node.js and websockets from ws and wss 

to run git clone the repo

you should have everything you need in terms of files to run

just cd into the prototype_wsservcli and do 'npm install' - this should install npm packages from your list of dependencies in the package.json file

your directory should look like this after (probably in a different order)

|->prototype_wsservcli <br/>
|-->node_modules(npm puts its stuff in here once you npm install) <br/>
|-->package-lock.json <br/>
|-->package.json <br/>
|-->server.js <br/>
|-->public <br/>
|--->index.html <br/>
|--->script.js <br/>
|--->styles.css <br/>

make sure you have node.js installed

then start the server with the command node server.js

navigate to localhost:3000 (default) to see the webpage locally
